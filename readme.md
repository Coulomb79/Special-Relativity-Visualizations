Prerequisites:
--------------
* geogebra version (at least):  5.0.134.0-3D  
    The current version can be found [here](https://www.geogebra.org/).
    
Notes:
-----
1) Some GUI elements may disappear using Linux or Mac OS, it seems to be a bug in GeoGebra.   
2) Even using Windows, it's possible that some of the GUI elements disappear depending on the screen resolution. For best user interaction a screen resolution of 1920x1080 is recommended.    

CommandListConstructProtocol
----------------------------
A list of commands to be entered in GeoGebra. You can construct a 2+1D Minkowski diagram via these commands. 
    
CoordinatesOfAnEvent
----------------------------
A relativistic moving point is moving in a 2+1D Minkowski diagram. The event coordinates can be read in both frames, the resting and the moving one. The 3D window can be moved and rotated to get a better overview of the scenario.  

MovingSquare-RestingObserver
----------------------------
A relativistic moving square is shown in a 2+1D Minkowski diagram. You can set an observer in the resting frame S to get an idea of what the observer measures and sees, when the square passes.  

MovingCircle-RestingObserver
----------------------------
A relativistic moving circle is shown in a 2+1D Minkowski diagram. You can set an observer in the resting frame S to get an idea of what the observer measures and sees, when the circle passes.
