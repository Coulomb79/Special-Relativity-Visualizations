CoordinatesOfAnEvent
----------------------------
A relativistic moving point is moving in a 2+1D Minkowski diagram. The event coordinates can be read in both frames, the resting and the moving one. The 3D window can be moved and rotated to get a better overview of the scenario.  

MovingSquare-RestingObserver
----------------------------
A relativistic moving square is shwon in a 2+1D Minkowski diagram. You can set a resting observer in the resting frame S to get an idea of what the observer measures and sees, when the square passes.  

MovingCircle-RestingObserver
----------------------------
A relativistic moving circle is shwon in a 2+1D Minkowski diagram. You can set a resting observer in the resting frame S to get an idea of what the observer measures and sees, when the circle passes.
